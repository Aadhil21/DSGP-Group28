# Exercise Posture Analysis and Recommendation System

## Overview
This project is designed to assist exercise beginners by analyzing their posture and providing personalized recommendations. The system uses Flutter for the frontend, Flask for the backend, and WebSocket for real-time communication. It incorporates image processing and machine learning techniques to classify postures and suggest appropriate exercises.

## Features
- **Real-Time Posture Analysis:** Analyzes user posture in real-time using image processing techniques.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** Provides exercise recommendations based on posture analysis.
- **Cross-Platform Interface:** Built with Flutter for a seamless user experience on various devices.
- **Backend API:** Developed using Flask to handle data processing and communication.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Utilizes WebSocket for instant data transmission and feedback.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Flutter
- **Backend:** Flask
- **Real-Time Communication:** WebSocket
- **Image Processing:** OpenCV
- **Machine Learning:** TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)
- **Database:** SQLite or another lightweight database (if applicable)

## Assumptions
- Users have access to a camera capable of capturing their exercise postures.
- The system assumes that posture images are captured in a controlled environment to ensure accuracy.
- The recommended exercises are based on predefined criteria and may require validation.
